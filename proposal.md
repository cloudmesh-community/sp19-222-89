Our proposed project will be a neural network which is trained to count the number of cells in a retinal scan image provided by the user. This project would involve collaboration with Dr Donald Miller of the IU School of Optometry, who specializes in detailed imaging of the human retina. In a recent presentation, Dr Miller mentioned having to manually count cells in an image which contained around 500 of them. We thought that sounded a little ridiculous, and that given how relatively well defined the boundaries of each cell are, there should be a way to use image processing and a little bit of machine learning to automate that process. 

The idea behind using the neural network is that it can be used to find the optimal combination of filters to use to detect the edges, delimit, and count the cells. Assuming Dr Miller has a nice dataset handy with precounted images (or images that we can count ourselves), there should be a sufficient amount of training data to create a nice model.
