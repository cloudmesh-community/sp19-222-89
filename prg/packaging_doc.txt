This is how to package a python app:
1)Create a fresh python virtual environment

2)Create directory structure. Root has the name of your package. Contained in
it is another directory with the package name, a requirements.txt, and a setup.py.

3)At bottom of directory structure (i.e. in the lowest directory with our package name)
write __init__.py file and your .py file that does whatever you want it to do.

4)Inside root directory, run pip freeze > requirements.txt
This will fill your requirements.txt with all dependencies that your package requires.

5)Inside root directory, run pip install -r requirements.txt

6)Now you're ready to use your package
